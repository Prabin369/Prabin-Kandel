<p>
I am a motivated Computer Science student with a strong interest in
software development and modern web technologies. I enjoy building
projects that help me understand both theoretical concepts and their
practical applications.

<p>
As a student, I focus on writing clean code, improving logical thinking,
and developing problem-solving skills. I believe consistency, curiosity,
and discipline are key to growth in the technology field.

<p>
My long-term goal is to become a skilled software professional and
contribute to meaningful technological solutions.
